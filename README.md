# SwiftNodes

👩🏻‍🚀 *This project [is still a tad experimental](#development-status). Contributors and pioneers welcome!*

## What?

SwiftNodes provides a `Graph` data structure and various graph algorithms.

It serves as critical infrastructure for the [Codeface](https://www.codeface.io) app.

## Architecture

Here is the internal architecture (composition and essential dependencies):

The above image was created with the [Codeface](https://www.codeface.io) app.

## Development Status

From version/tag 0.1.0 on, SwiftNodes adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). So until it has reached 1.0.0, its API may still break frequently, but this will be expressed in version bumps.

SwiftNodes is already being used in production, but [Codeface](https://codeface.io) is still its primary client. SwiftNodes will move to version 1.0.0 as soon as its basic practicality and conceptual soundness have been validated by serving multiple real-world clients.
